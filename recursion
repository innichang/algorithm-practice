What is recursion?
Recursion is a problem solving technique where a big problem is broken down into smaller instances of the same problem.

Recursion - a function calling itself.

Why do we use recursion?
It simplies the big problem.

I want to talk about when it's bad to choose recursion as the problem solving technique.

  1. When the problem has a linear structure or can be solved iteratively using loops.
  2. When the depth of recursion becomes too large -> stack overflow error or slows down program.
  3. Hard to understand or main if recursion is used

When it's good to use recursion.

  1. When the problem has a recursive structure or can be naturally divided into sub-problems.
  2. When size of the problem is not too large and depth of recursion is not too deep.
  3. When the code is easier to write and understand using recursion rather than iterative structure.

  1. Tree traversal: ?
  2. Search and pathfinding: ?
  3. Sorting: ?
